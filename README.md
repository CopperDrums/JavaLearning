# Read this document before uploading any file! #

When uploading codes, everyone must have his own folder.

To create your folder, when you upload your file, specify at the top you want to create in a folder called (your name).

Exercises will be divided in numbered folders (found in the "Projects" tab), starting from 001 (basics).
All exercises will be numbered from 01 for easier understanding.

            E.G.: 001 - 01 - NameOfExercise
            
**To Do** = nobody has finished the exercise yet.

**In Progress** = some submitted their solution, not everyone.

**Done** = everyone submitted his solution.




Everyone can upload as many solutions as desired in the main repository, as long as they are labeled according to their version:

      E.G.: 001_01_GM v1.0;
            001_01_GM v1.1;
      
            and so forth.
            
This naming convention will make it easier for all of out codes to stick together when they will increase in number.



? To upload, go in the main "<> Code" page and press on "Create new file". Paste your code in, and name it according to the above convention.
