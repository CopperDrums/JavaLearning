Different specs will be uploaded in separate folders, and more will keep on being uploaded.

Exercises will be divided in numbered folders (found in the "Projects" tab), starting from 001 (basics), in the following format:

            001 - NameOfExercise
            


Everyone can upload as many solutions as desired in the main repository, as long as they are labeled according to their version:

      E.G.: 001_ExerciseName_GM v1.0;
            001_ExerciseName_GM v1.1;
      
            and so forth.
            
This naming convention will make it easier for all of out codes to stick together when they will increase in number.
