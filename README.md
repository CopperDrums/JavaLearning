# Read this document before uploading any file! #

When uploading codes, everyone must have their own folder.

Please create your own folder called "your name" in which you will upload all of your files.

Exercises will be divided in numbered folders (found in the "Projects" tab), starting from 001 (basics).

            E.G.: 001 - 01 - NameOfExercise
            
**To Do** = nobody has finished the exercise yet.

**In Progress** = some submitted their solution, not everyone.

**Done** = everyone submitted his solution.




Everyone can upload as many solutions as desired in the main repository. Add future versions of your code as a comment in your original submission.

      E.G.: 001_01;
            001_02;
      
            and so forth.
            

? To upload, go in the main "<> Code" page and press on "Create new file". Paste your code in, and name it according to the above convention.
